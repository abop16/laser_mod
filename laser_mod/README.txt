Laser Mod for Minetest, v0.1.0
Please give me feedback and suggestions! (email at bottom)
Description

This mod introduces a laser emitter and receiver into the world of Minetest, allowing players to create laser beams that can destroy nodes and deal damage to players. The laser's color can be customized by punching the emitter with different dyes.
Features:

    Laser Emitter: Emits a laser that destroys any nodes in its path (except for laser receivers).
    Laser Receiver: Stops the laser beam when it hits the receiver node.
    Customizable Laser Color: Players can change the color of the laser by punching the emitter with dye items.
    Damage to Players: The laser will cause damage to players if the damage feature is enabled.

Installation
1. Download and Extract the Mod

    Download the mod files.
    Extract the laser_mod folder to your Minetest worldmods or mods directory:
        World Mods: ~/.minetest/worlds/[your_world]/worldmods/
        Global Mods: ~/.minetest/mods/

2. Enable the Mod

    Open Minetest and load your world.
    Go to the "Mods" section.
    Find the laser_mod in the mod list and enable it.

3. Optional - Customize Laser Color

To change the laser color, punch the laser emitter node with any dye item (such as dye:red, dye:blue, etc.).
Usage

    Place a Laser Emitter node in the world, and it will begin emitting a laser.
    The laser will travel in the direction it is facing and destroy any nodes in its path, except for Laser Receiver nodes.
    To stop the laser, place a Laser Receiver node where the laser will hit.
    Punch the Laser Emitter with any dye to change the laser's color.

Known Issues

    Ensure that the emitter is facing in the right direction; the laser will only emit in the direction it's facing.
    The laser only interacts with blocks in its direct path. It will not curve or change direction automatically.
    The laser mod currently uses dummy pictures, custom textures coming soon!
